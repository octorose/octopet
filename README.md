## introduction
This malware project is designed for ethical use only. It is intended to simulate the behavior of real malware for educational and research purposes, and should not be used for any malicious or harmful activities. The goal of this project is to improve our understanding of how malware works and how to detect and defend against it.

2 Create a shell function (wait for an incoming command and iterate over certain options)

3 run on boot time (auto launch on booting the machine)

4 start/spawn other programs

5 Navigation through different directories

6 Implementing a keylogger to our Backdoor
